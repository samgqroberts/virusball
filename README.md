## References
This project's trajectory has also been my trajectory in learning WebGL.
That education has so far consisted of these tutorials:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial
* https://github.com/davidwparker/programmingtil-webgl/blob/master/0027-drawing-a-circle/index.js

And then, after a few hours unsuccessfully trying to force an oval into circular proportions, I went back to fundamentals and tried to gain broad familiarity in WebGL as a whole (helped a lot!):

Inspiring the move to more simple 2D operations rather than the more complex matrix operations from the first tutorial:
