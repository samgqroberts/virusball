# Virusball

In 2013 I took my first few steps into Javascript by making a game called Supervirus ( [code](https://github.com/SylverStudios/Supervirus) | [play it!](https://sylverstudios.github.io/games/2019/02/16/supervirus.html) ).
Over 6 years later it's still one of my favorite things.
The game mechanics are dead simple, but (I think, though I'm biased...) satisfying.

Virusball is a spiritual successor to Supervirus in a couple ways.
One, I'm using this project as a way take my first few steps into WebGL.
Two, I want to reproduce the same simple-yet-satisfying feeling, using similar circles-moving-through-2D-space forms.
But this time there's a ball involved!

## Running Locally
1. Install NPM @ 6.x
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run start`

This will begin serving the project on localhost:8080

## References
This project's trajectory has also been my trajectory in learning WebGL.
That education has so far consisted of these tutorials:

* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API/Tutorial
* https://github.com/davidwparker/programmingtil-webgl/blob/master/0027-drawing-a-circle/index.js

And then, after a few hours unsuccessfully trying to force an oval into circular proportions, I went back to fundamentals and tried to gain broad familiarity in WebGL as a whole (helped a lot!):

Inspiring the move to more simple 2D operations rather than the more complex matrix operations from the first tutorial:
